            Alright guys, I'm doing "Take On Me" now <br>
            Alright, ha-pa-ba-ba-ba <br>
            I, I really, I really like this song, it sounds good <br>
            Minin' away, I don't know what to mine <br>
            I'll mine this anyway in this Minecraft day <br>
            So beautiful, mine further down <br>
            What's that I found? <br>
            Mine diamonds (take on me) <br>
            Mine diamonds (take on me) <br>
            I'll mine them <br>
            So far I've got two <br>
            So easy to mine with my Minecraft pickaxe and shovels <br>
            Hopefully they stay in my Minecraft chests <br>
            So I'm gonna make a lock on it <br>
            Mine diamonds <br>
            Mine diamonds <br>
            I'll mine them <br>
            So far I've got two, ah <br>
            I'm alright, I'm ready <br>
            All these diamonds sittin' carefully away <br>
            I'm getting worried if they might get stolen (turn it off) <br>
            From my ender chest <br>
            Wait, who is that? <br>
            Holy sheep, it's Notch! <br>
            Mine diamonds <br>
            Mine diamonds <br>
            Now they're safe now <br>
            Now that they're safe now <br>
            Mine diamonds <br>
            Mine diamonds <br>
            Uh, uh, thanks <br>
            Thanks for listening guys and thanks for recommending this song
